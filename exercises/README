This tarball contains exercises for the Intro to Moose class. Here's
what's what ...

t/*.t - each .t file contains instructions on what the exercise is,
and runs the tests to check your code.

t/lib - includes a recent copy of the Test-Harness and Test-Simple
modules so we're all on the same page, as well as some other modules
used in the tests.

t/lib/MooseClass/Tests.pm - the actual tests all live in this
module. It also shows many examples of how to use Moose's metaclass
APIs for introspection.

bin/prove - a slightly hacked version of prove that makes sure to look
in t/lib first. If you have a recent version of prove installed, this
can be ignored, but it's worth trying if you have any weird problems.

tarballs - Moose, Class::MOP, and all their dependencies.

lib - this will be your working directory for most exercises. You'll
be creating various classes and roles in here, and then testing
against the test code.

answers - code that passes all the tests for each section. You can
look in here if you're stuck, or if you just want to see how someone
else did these exercises.
