# Your tasks ...
#
# Create a Printable role. This role should simply require that the
# consuming class implement an "as_string" method.
#
# Make the Person class from the last set of exercises consume this
# role. Use printable_name as the output for the as_string method. The
# Employee subclass should still override this output.
#
# Implement a role HasMoney. This should provide a read-write
# "balance" attribute. It should also implement "deposit" and
# "withdraw" methods. Attempting to reduce the cash balance below 0
# via "withdraw" should die with an error that includes the string:
#
#  Balance cannot be negative
#
# Make the Person class consumes this role as well.
#
# Make sure all roles are free of Moose droppings.
